    <h2>Purpose & Guiding Principle</h2>
    <p>
        ValYou Hub was designed around one simple idea: make valuation learnable and usable — not as an abstract academic exercise but as a practical skill somebody can pick up, practice, and apply. Everything on the site (layout, tone, interactions, and content sequence) exists to lower friction, build confidence fast, and convert curiosity into competency.
    </p>
    <p>
        We treated the site as a guided learning funnel: reduce upfront friction, then progressively reveal credibility, structure, and practice opportunities for those who stay. The order of information and the visual hierarchy were decided to match a user’s natural attention and learning psychology — not to fill the page with everything at once.
    </p>

    <h2>Color Scheme: Blue & White</h2>
    <p>
        We intentionally selected a blue and white color palette because colors are not just visual choices — they are psychological triggers. Blue is widely recognized in finance for evoking trust, stability, intelligence, and professionalism. It mirrors the tones seen in major financial institutions, making our platform feel credible and industry-aligned right from the first glance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The white provides clarity, breathing space, and a clean modern aesthetic. It ensures that complex financial topics are not visually overwhelming, instead appearing approachable and structured. We also use contrasting shades to ensure important buttons, CTAs (Call-to-Action), and headers stand out — improving accessibility and ease of navigation, even for colorblind users.
    </p>

    <h2>Homepage</h2>
    <p>
        Placing Start Learning immediately after the motto is intentional and research-driven:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Catch people when attention is highest:</b> On page arrival users have limited attention; placing a clear action (“Start Learning”) above the fold converts curiosity into immediate engagement.</li>
        <li><b>Reduce cognitive load and friction:</b> Instead of forcing visitors to hunt for the course link, we give a single, clear path forward. This is Hick’s Law in practice: fewer initial choices accelerate decision-making.</li>
        <li><b>Respect different user goals:</b> Some visitors want to jump straight into a course. Others want reassurance first. By surfacing the action first we satisfy both types.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scrolling</h2>
    <p>
        Scrolling is an expression of interest. If a visitor scrolls past the CTA, that behavior signals they want more context before engaging. They’re asking: “Why should I trust this? Will this actually help me?” We answer this with credibility content immediately after.
    </p>
    <p>
        This sequence — CTA → proof → deeper content — is a classic conversion flow. The CTA invites action; the proof validates it.
    </p>

    <h2>Founders, Credibility and Social Proof</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Founders & credentials:</b> Humanizes the brand and demonstrates domain competence.</li>
        <li><b>Testimonials & success metrics:</b> Real learner outcomes reduce perceived risk.</li>
        <li><b>Demo & “Does it work?”:</b> Interactive proof after trust has been established.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Flow of Content </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Hero Section:</b> Motto + Start Learning CTA for instant engagement.</li>
        <li><b>Impact Metrics:</b> Follows scrolling behavior to build trust.</li>
        <li><b>What’s In It For You:</b> Highlights learner benefits directly.</li>
        <li><b>Founders Section:</b> Adds relatability and credibility.</li>
        <li><b>Proof of Effectiveness:</b> Real stats and testimonials.</li>
        <li><b>Demo Section & Footer:</b> Multiple conversion opportunities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Courses Page </h2>
